# Computer Vision Image Manipulation and Visualization

This project demonstrates various image manipulation and visualization techniques using OpenCV and Matplotlib. The key tasks performed include:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting color images to grayscale for simpler processing.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on grayscale images.
- **Image Addition and Subtraction**: Loading and resizing two images, followed by addition and subtraction to analyze pixel-level interactions.
- **Distance Metrics Visualization**: Generating and visualizing patterns based on different distance metrics:
  - **Euclidean Distance (Circle)**
  - **Manhattan Distance (Diamond)**
  - **Chessboard Distance (Square)**

## Results

The following visualizations are generated:
- **Grayscale Image**: Displays the image after removing color information.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Shows the effects of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing pixel values.
- **Image Operations**: Demonstrates the addition and subtraction of two resized images.
- **Distance Metric Patterns**: Visual representations of Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chessboard distance metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output

The project produces images showing the results of the above operations, visualized using Matplotlib for easy comparison.
