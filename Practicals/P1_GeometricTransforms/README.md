# Computer Vision Image Manipulation and Visualization

For easy access and execution, you can open this project in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQPjacafaOQhcsqGUejJ0wrZ4p_hEs54?usp=sharing).

This project demonstrates image manipulation and visualization techniques using OpenCV and Matplotlib, including:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Simplifying images by removing color.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on grayscale images.
- **Image Addition/Subtraction**: Analyzing pixel-level interactions between resized images.
- **Distance Metrics Visualization**: Generating patterns based on:
  - **Euclidean Distance (Circle)**
  - **Manhattan Distance (Diamond)**
  - **Chessboard Distance (Square)**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output

The project produces images visualizing the results of the above operations, displayed using Matplotlib for easy comparison.
