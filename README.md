## Environment

The **Google Colab environment** will be used for all practicals and projects in this course. Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Colab notebook:

- **OpenCV** (`cv2`)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-image**
- **scikit-learn**

You can install any additional libraries as needed using `!pip install <library-name>`.

### Laboratory Exercises / Practicals

The practicals covered in this course are summarized below:

| Practical | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Practical 1** | Geometric transformations of an image |
| **Practical 2** | Texture feature extraction using GLCM / Gabor transform |
| **Practical 3** | Morphological operations |
| **Practical 4** | Chain coding and decoding |
| **Practical 5** | Image registration |
| **Practical 6** | Face recognition using Viola-Jones algorithm or similar application |
| **Practical 7** | Disparity estimation / Depth map generation |
| **Practical 8** | 3D modeling |

Each practical will have its own Colab notebook, and links to them will be provided once they are completed.

### Projects

| Project | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Project 1** | Disparity map generation and depth estimation from stereo images |
| **Project 2** | Face detection and recognition using Viola-Jones or HOG-SVM |

Projects will be implemented and documented in Colab notebooks.
