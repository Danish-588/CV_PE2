## Environment

This course will be primarily carried out in the **VSCode** environment. Ensure you have the following setup on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (preferably the latest version)
- **VSCode** (Visual Studio Code)

### Required Libraries

Install the following libraries using `pip`:

- **OpenCV** (`cv2`): For computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizations.
- **scikit-image**: For image processing tasks.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks.
- **Pillow**: For general image handling.

To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn Pillow
```

### Laboratory Exercises / Practicals

The practicals covered in this course are summarized below:

| Practical | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **[Practical 1](Practicals/P1_GeometricTransforms/)** | Geometric transformations of an image |
| **Practical 2** | Texture feature extraction using GLCM / Gabor transform |
| **Practical 3** | Morphological operations |
| **Practical 4** | Chain coding and decoding |
| **Practical 5** | Image registration |
| **Practical 6** | Face recognition using Viola-Jones algorithm or similar application |
| **Practical 7** | Disparity estimation / Depth map generation |
| **Practical 8** | 3D modeling |

Each practical will have its own Colab notebook, and links to them will be provided once they are completed.
